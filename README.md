# Hey there! üëã

I'm a **Frontend Developer** and **DevRel** at Superteam, where I focus on building amazing developer communities and driving engagement in the Web3 ecosystem. Currently, I'm working on **XDEGEN**, a decentralized demo trading app that teaches users how to trade in a fun and educational environment. I've worked with several industries across the web2, and web3 ecosystem. Where I contributed to build real-estate applications, e-commerce, and e-learning platfroms, trading platforms, Dex, and more.

## üî• Currently Working On:
- **XDEGEN**: A demo trading platform designed to teach users how to trade DeFi assets, with a focus on making the experience fun and informative. The app allows users to trade using demo assets while learning the ropes of decentralized trading. With an extension of the application, "[XdegenPro](https://x.com/UnclePhil_01/status/1932768454186320138)". A proprietary trading platform in the solana ecosystem designed for the high-stakes world of memecoins. It connects skilled traders with crypto investors who want exposure to the volatility of memecoins without trading themselves.

## üöÄ About Me:
- I'm passionate about creating user-friendly interfaces and building decentralized applications (dApps).
- Developer Advocate at **Superteam**: I engage with developers, provide resources, and help build the next generation of Web3 technology.
- I specialize in frontend technologies (React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Solana development, Three.js, Next) and enjoy experimenting with new tools and frameworks like Shadcn, tailwindcss, to improve the developer experience.
